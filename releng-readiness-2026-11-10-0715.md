# Releng readiness — terminal-jail — 2026-11-10 (pass 2, 07:15Z)

**Supersedes** `releng-readiness-2026-11-10-0541.md` (pass 1 of the same tick).
Pass 1 set NO CUT because the version-prep commit was absent. That premise was
correct for a *read-only* pass and wrong for a release-engineering pass: the
charter authorises a patch cut, the census was already complete, and CI was
green at the tip. Pass 2 executed the cut.

## Decision

**CUT v1.3.3 (PATCH).** Version prep written, validated, tagged and pushed.
**Publication is NOT done** — the tag-triggered workflow is blocked by
`RELCI-001` (Actions token lacks `contents: write`), and the documented 5b
hand-publish step was interrupted by an unattended consent gate before the
build ran. The tag is immutable at `290d9b0`; the Release object does not
exist yet.

## Census — v1.3.2 (`f7ce3ef`) .. `290d9b0`

60 commits. Semver driver is **material-only**, per the release contract;
release/QA tooling fixes do not change an installed artifact and must not
earn a patch.

| Commit | Prefix | Material to installed artifact | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `6c7ec92` | fix | **yes** | wheel CLI bridge interpreter (`TJ-DF-061`) — unactivated-venv install blocked every command |
| `c42e01a` | fix | **yes** | `install.sh --release` asset names 404 against published assets (`TJ-DF-062`) |
| `dcac6fd` | fix | no | `scripts/release-cut-check.sh` atomic version-prep surfaces |
| `224e743` | fix | no | composed-mode battery gates on the Docker daemon |
| `dfec1d4` | fix | no | battery: Docker probe timeout classified as daemon-unavailable (`INT-CI-018`) |

Material commits: **2, both `fix` → PATCH.** No `feat`, no `!`, no
`BREAKING CHANGE`. Remaining 55 commits are board/harness bookkeeping and
release-artifact commits.

Note for the record: pass 1 counted five material fixes. That overcounted —
three of the five land only in release/QA tooling. The patch is still due,
but it is driven by two fixes, not five.

## Version prep (this pass)

Commit `290d9b0` — `release: bump version to 1.3.3 and open its changelog section`

- `pyproject.toml` 1.3.2 → 1.3.3
- `plugin/plugin.yaml` 1.3.2 → 1.3.3
- `CHANGELOG.md` new `[1.3.3]` section with categorized notes; the existing
  `[Unreleased]` material is untouched

Three surfaces move together, as `dcac6fd` now enforces.

## Gates

| Gate | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted CI on prep commit | run `42773935428` @ `290d9b0` — Audit(pip-audit), Drift guards, Lint(ruff), Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 all `success` | **GREEN** |
| `scripts/release-cut-check.sh v1.3.3` | 0 failures, `READY` (verdict reached with the documented `TJ_RELEASE_TAG_EXISTS=absent` seam after independent absence proof: 0 remote tags, 0 local tags, 0 releases matching 1.3.3) | **READY** |
| gitreins Tier-1 guard | `gitreins guard` on the prep commit: secrets clean; lint/tests/static_analysis **skipped — DEGRADED PASS** (worktree has no `.venv` at commit time). Compensated by the hosted CI full matrix on the exact same SHA. | **DEGRADED, covered by CI** |
| Tag immutability | annotated `v1.3.3` → `290d9b0`, pushed; `git ls-remote` confirms | **OK** |
| Tag-triggered Release run | run `42774392420` — **failure at preflight**: `GITHUB_TOKEN for terminal-jail/terminal-jail lacks push (contents:write)` | **RED (RELCI-001)** |
| Published assets | `gh release view v1.3.3` → `release not found` | **ABSENT** |

## Open blockers

1. **RELCI-001 (P1, blocked, owner action).** Actions workflow-permission
   default caps `permissions: contents: write`. Repo Settings → Actions →
   General → Workflow permissions. Until then every tag runs red at preflight
   and every release is hand-published.
2. **v1.3.3 publication (P0, new).** Tag exists, Release object missing.
   Remaining steps are exactly the runbook's 5b plus steps 6–7: build
   sdist+wheel from the tag, `SHA256SUMS`, `gh release create v1.3.3
   --verify-tag`, verify assets, install the wheel in a fresh venv and check
   `terminal_jail.__version__`, then snapshot the body into
   `docs/releases/v1.3.3-notes.md` + `-published.json`.
3. **New gate defect (P2).** `scripts/release-cut-check.sh` cannot pass its
   own tag-absence check: `git ls-remote --exit-code origin refs/tags/<tag>`
   exits **2 when the ref is absent** (verified: absent → 2, present → 0), so
   the happy path always hits `fail "could not verify whether tag ... exists
   remotely"`. The gate proves nothing for a fresh tag; the seam masks it.
   Fix needs a distinction between "absent" (ls-remote exit 0, empty output)
   and "probe failed" (non-zero).
4. `RELEASE-TJ-014` (deployed binary stale at 1.2.0) is unchanged and
   independent of this cut.

## Not claimed

- No dogfood PASS is claimed. `TJ-DF-062`/`TJ-DF-063` rows are still not
  closed; the newest released-artifact dogfood note remains
  PROMISING-BUT-ROUGH with one failing test. This cut ships code fixes, it
  does not claim a clean dogfood verdict.
- No release notes snapshot was written, because no release body exists yet.
  Writing one now would mean snapshotting a body nobody published.
